--for create table 
TABLE squad
{
    squad_id int [pk]
    squad_name varchar
    squad_code varchar

--if you want some column to be set as primary key

TABLE sportsmen
{
    sportsmen_id integer [pk]   //[pk] is the primary key for the 'sportsmen_id' here
    sportsmen_name varchar [not null]
    dob date
    batting_hand varchar
    bowling_hand varchar

    sportsmen_id int
    squad_id int
    wicket_keeper int
    squad_captain int
}

REF: sportsmen.sportsmen_id < sportsmen_game.sportsmen_id   // referencing one primary key to the other as foreign key
